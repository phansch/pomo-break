# pomo-break

`pomo-break` is a cross-platform pomodoro/break timer.

You can use it for normal pomodoro cycles as well as only for break reminders.

Note: Currently, `pomo-break` is only tested on Ubuntu/Debian. Based on all
current dependencies it _should_ work on other platforms as well. Please don't
hesitate to [open an issue] if you run into problems.
